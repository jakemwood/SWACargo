## Overview
This is a quick Python script that will approximate the cost of shipping a package through Southwest Airlines Cargo.

## Disclaimer
To state the obvious, by using this software, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for any errors or omissions in the rate calculation process.  This calculator was written based on the rules and rates published on [SWACargo's web site](http://swacargo.com/), and should give you a ballpark figure of the cost of shipping with Southwest.

Furthermore, I am not affiliated with Southwest in any way shape or form.  Well, my aunt works for them, but that's irrelevant.  The little logo used here in the readme is probably property of Southwest.

## Installation
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/jakemwood/SWACargo`
2. `$ cd SWACargo`
3. `% ./SWACargo

## Feedback
This is a pet project I originally wrote in TypeScript in an attempt to learn that language.  I ported it to Python to sharpen my Python skills in preparation for starting a new job.  As such, this project is very low on my priority list.  If you'd like to submit a pull request, that's fine by me, but expect little to no maintenance to this calculator (including upkeep on the rate tables).

**Pull requests definitely encouraged in case Southwest decides to change their rates.  Thank you!**
